# Tower-Of-Hanoi
Implementation of Generalised Tower of Hanoi problem.

**Main** - implements an application that solves Generalised Tower of Hanoi problem using Frame â€“ Stewart algorithm.

* Moves are printed out in a verbose form during runtime. 

* All the moves are saved in a .txt file in a specific compact format:
  - First row (representing input): number of discs number of towers source tower destination tower.
  - Every next row (representing single move): disc number source tower destination tower.


**CorrectnessCheck** - implements an application that checks the correctness of a solution for the above problem. 

* It takes as an input a sequence of moves which is a .txt file formatted as mentioned above.
